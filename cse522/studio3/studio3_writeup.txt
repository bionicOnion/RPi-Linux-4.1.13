dense_mm: Generates matrices of a user-specified size and multiplies them
parallel_dense_mm: Same as dense_mm (but presumably with multiple threads)
sing: Prints out n repititions of a quote from the Lord of the Rings, where n is user-specified
sort: Generates and sorts some sort of list

CLOCK_MONOTONIC would be good for benchmarking--the time values returned are high-resolution and are not subject to changes to the system clock (which might affect the accuracy of the readings)
CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE would be bad both because of the low fidelity of the timing readings and because of the effect that changing the system clock would have on the output.

The coarse timers run at a frequency of 100Hz (every 10,000,000 nanoseconds), whereas the high resolution timers can operate with nanosecond accuracy.

CLOCK_MONOTONIC is likely using the high-resolution timing subsystem, while CLOCK_MONOTONIC_COARSE is update once per update to the jiffies variable (e.g. HZ times per second, which--on the ARM architecture--would be 100 times, consistent with our findings).

A call to gettime() appears to take roughly 2,000 nanoseconds (timed with CLOCK_MONOTONIC).
