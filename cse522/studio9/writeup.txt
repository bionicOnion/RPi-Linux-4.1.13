In this case, the process was only preempted rarely by software interrupts (rcuc/0-11 seems to be the most common interrupting process).

6.
The interruptions occur at more regular intervals in the modified version (likely when the scheduler runs at the end of round robin rounds).

7.
A total of 182 sched_switch events happened on CPU 0 (the one on which the process was running). In contrast, 25,826 sched_switch events occured on CPU 1

8.
The real-time priorities in use are 1, 50, and 99 (effecitvely encompassing high-, medium-, and low-priority real-time processes).
ksoftirqd/0 has an RTPRIO of 1, which is consistent with its role of handling system call requests: it's important that the requests be handled in a timely manner so that the waiting process can continue to make progress, but it's not so critical that it needs to preempt or prevent other important work.
Conversely, the migration family of processes have a priority of 99: it's critically important that a process maintain a coherent view of memory and that it exist in its entirety on a given CPU before being scheduled (and the opposite), so preemption of the migration process should be avoided at all costs.

9.
Only 14 sched_switch events occured on CPU 0, all of which were at the beginning and end of execution of the test process (which was never preempted).

10.
Because a real-time process won't cede the processor to another process until its execution has finished (or it somehow yields its position as a real-time process), it is impossible to interleave two real-time processes on a single core.

12.
With three real-time processes running, each of them shares the processor even, with roughly .2 ms per process in a round robin ordering. This means that every process is able to (more or less) closely emulate real-time performance without preventing other processes with real-time priority from making progress.
