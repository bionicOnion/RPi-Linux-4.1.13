Although the system has slowed down slightly, overall performance is roughly the same (which is consistent with the description of the completely fair scheduler; any other tasks will be allowed to preempt the processes which are eating up most of the system resources and do whatever comparitively small tasks that they require).

Without background tasks:

pi@raspberrypi ~/522/RPi-Linux-4.1.13/cse522/studio7 $ time ./dense_mm 300
Generating matrices...
Multiplying matrices...
Multiplication done!

real	0m3.134s
user	0m3.050s
sys	0m0.000s


With background tasks:

pi@raspberrypi ~/522/RPi-Linux-4.1.13/cse522/studio7 $ time ./dense_mm 300
Generating matrices...
Multiplying matrices...
Multiplication done!

real	0m6.411s
user	0m3.070s
sys	0m0.010s

Although the process required the same amount of total processing time to complete, the amount of real time taken to complete nearly doubled--again consistent with fair scheduling; when multiple processes require a significant amount of processing time, they'll share it more even with one another.

real time would increase, but user would remain stable

pi@raspberrypi ~/522/RPi-Linux-4.1.13/cse522/studio7 $ time ./dense_mm 300
Generating matrices...
Multiplying matrices...
Multiplication done!

real	0m9.394s

As expected, user time remained stable while real time increased dramatically.
